# bobbot
A Slackbot that mimics my colleague Bob, based on this tutorial: http://hirelofty.com/blog/how-build-slack-bot-mimics-your-colleague/

The bot uses the markovify library to generate sentences, based on the previous Slack messages of your colleague. 

Why Bob? Because Bob is my mentor, taught me a lot, and can now reap the...benefits of that, I guess. Thanks Bob!
